Special thanks to James Nam (sn29@illinois.edu), a PhD student at UIUC, for providing many constructive suggestions in robot programming.

The team extends its gratitude to the following groups and individuals. Project advisor Mr. Michael Brunetto provided extensive support with the economic analysis of the project and facilitated the connection with the General Motors automation team. Appreciation is also given to Prof. James Allison and Dr. Daniel Metz for their detailed feedback and constructive suggestions on reports and presentations, which significantly strengthened the overall quality of the project.

Special thanks are extended to the UTLX team in Muscatine, Iowa, for generously pausing plant operations to ensure a safe environment for the design team to enter the confined space of a railcar. Mr. Troy McKim and Mr. Derek Adams offered exceptional assistance throughout the semester, going above and beyond by providing thoughtful, detailed responses to technical questions and arranging an additional meeting to discuss economic considerations. Mr. Wyatt Blake contributed valuable technical expertise regarding the spray coating process used for the railcar interior. Appreciation is also given to Marmon Holdings in Chicago and Mr. Vincenzo DiFatta for their guidance and efforts in the coordination of the shipment of the industrial robot to the UIUC campus.

Lastly, gratitude is extended to the UIUC Industrial and Systems Engineering Department for providing this senior capstone experience and coordinating a hands-on engineering project with industry partners that generated meaningful real-world impact. Special thanks go to Dr. Tom Titone and Tracey Rich for facilitating the senior design course, and to Lucas Osborne for coordinating the purchase of the materials and tools needed to complete the project.
